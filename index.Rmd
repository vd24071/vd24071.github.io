My name is Vanessa Dinh and this website describes a little bit about me! Check the navigation bar above for my resume, email address, github account, and linkedin.

I'm a second year MPH candidate in Epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science.

I enjoy playing soccer in co-ed leagues, traveling, snow sports, and eating good (reasonably priced) food!
